o  Requested: --spc spc --csv -c 1 

   Temperature = 298.15 Kelvin   Concentration = 1.0 mol/L
   All energetic values below shown in Hartree unless otherwise specified.

   Using vibrational scale factor 1.0 for PBE1PBE/6-31+G(d) level of theory

   Caution! Implicit solvation (SMD/CPCM) detected. Enthalpic and entropic terms cannot be safely separated. Use them at your own risk!

   Entropic quasi-harmonic treatment: frequency cut-off value of 100.0 wavenumbers will be applied.
   QS = Grimme: Using a mixture of RRHO and Free-rotor vibrational entropies.
